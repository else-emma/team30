      <h3>1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do? </h3>
      <p></p>

      <h3></h3>
      <p>I am doing a number of things. My title is a digital technology manager and I look after the development and support of digital applications for a company called Bupa it is a health insurance company.</p>
      <p>We build the software systems for Bupa from the initial phases, like from designing and building until deployment, after that we maintain it.</p>

      <p>Developing training courses , thinking about training costs, and thinking what sort of things my team will need in the future. </p>
      <p>And now we have a concept of product development rather than the project. So we maintain the product life cycle. So in a nutshell, that is what we are doing. And also I have some duties related to people management as well. </p>


      <h3>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h3>
      <p>IT within the Insurance industry is very complex, we have different systems, for example customer information which is very sensitive, therefore we work in a very highly regulated environment that we need to adhere to. We work with huge data sets, globally our company has more than 30 million customers.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>

      <h3>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h3>
      <p>I hire developers most of the time. Occasionally I hire people from the UX and UI, perspective, but most of the time I hire developers, so like in front end developers, and also, managing some tech leads.</p>
      <p>Managing people is tough, but very enjoyable. And especially now when all of us are working from home so that's extra added difficulty and complexity on top of that.</p>
      <p>Building the team cultures is another thing I want to mention. This is advisable for any organization, not just Bupa So in this current situation, we need to be very mindful about mental health and people. </p>
      <p>Part of my role is also to resolve conflicts, make sure that everyone's happy.</p>
      <p></p>

      <h3>4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them. </h3>
      <p>Developers, testers, UX people, product owners, scrum masters, product managers.</p>
      <p>Outside the delivery team: business stakeholders</p>
      <p>Other IT teams: security, infrastructure</p>
      <p>Bupa Partners</p>

      <h3>5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h3>
      <p>Other IT teams: security, infrastructure</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>

      <h3>6. What about your interactions with clients or investors? </h3>
      <p> I don't have clients because my client is Bupa. So we think about our business as our client, but it's not quite correct because we are in the same team, so we don't have the concept of clients. And we don't have the concept investors.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>

      <h3>7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these. </h3>
      <p>It really depends on the day, but most of the time it is meetings.
So communication is a big part, but other than that I also spend a lot of time thinking about the strategy for the team and the department. Also I've mentioned before the production issues, that I need to look after.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>

      <h3>8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging? </h3>
      <p>I find it most challenging implementing new ideas, because currently, you know, in the IT industry everything's evolving very quickly and very fast, and we need to move with that speed, which is challenging.</p>
      <p>Also pushbacks from different teams and coming up with an agreement between them.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>

      <h3>9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h3>
      <p>Impact analysis, talking to different teams like the network team, talking to the security team, taking into account different things.</p>
      <p>Most important thing, I think, is probably evaluating the benefits against the effort that you're spending to build and to maintain a software or a system. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>

      <h3>10. How do you think the industry has changed since you started in IT? </h3>
      <p>I think it changes so much,in terms of technologies that are being widely used such as cloud and containerization, like docker.</p>
      <p>The production speed has increased,we come up with an idea, we test it and release it as fast as possible.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>

      <h3>11. What personal qualities do you think will help someone in a modern IT role? What do you think employers are after?</h3>
      <p>Obviously, we need you to know the technical aspects of the job, but also a very important quality that I look for is a can do attitude.</p>
      <p>We are also looking for team players who can work as part of the team.
Innovative thinking</p>
      <p>Honesty</p>
      <p>A person who is not afraid of a challenge</p>

      <h3> What do you see as the growth areas in IT? And what do you think are the more exciting areas?</h3>
      <p>I come from a software development background, so from my perspective it is AI, machine learning. I believe in the future a lot of systems will be utilizing the AI</p>

      <h3> 13. What advice would you have for newcomers to IT employment? </h3>
      <p>Having the ability to learn quickly in a very fast changing IT environment. To develop good inner qualities that I have mentioned before, a can do attitude is very important. Being able to come up with new ideas and innovative approaches. Try to make a portfolio and work on projects that you can later show to a potential employer, do some freelancing. </p>
