<h1>Roles</h1>
<p>
As noted in Career Plans, at the start of our project Team 30 considered and discussed appointing project roles in line with our ideal jobs from Assignment 2. We didn’t formalize anything, however interestingly we seemed to naturally gravitate to those kinds of roles anyway and volunteered to deliver content in line with our strengths.
